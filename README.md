# Command-Line-Tools
CLT or Command Line Tools allows to use as well as include these tools into other projects.

# About
CLT allows users to either use the programs that are pre built in this repository or include them in their code to use their functions. It is a powerful tool and makes sure that users don't spend too much time just to write specific functions that can be done easily by importing the specified file.

# Os Requirement
CLT can runs on multiple Operating Systems but many files are OS specific and there are only available to these OS -

Windows, Linux

# Windows
CLT uses the Windows header file and more to do various tasks that communicates with the OS itself such as making a window, gui, running apps, etc.

# Linux
CLT uses Linux in the same way as Windows.

# Cross Platform
CLT also has cross platform files which can run on any os as long as you build them for the specific os otherwise CLT build folder only offers Windows (.exe) and linux (.elf) pre-built files.

These cross platform files are supposed to work normally on any OS and can be included in any cpp file. These files work cross platform as it doesn't communicate with the OS itself but rather uses pre-made C++ libraries (built in) to do the job. Thanks to this the compiler can build the file in any os executable format and it would work normally.
